# GateNexus Supabase Documentation

Welcome to the GateNexus database documentation. This document provides a detailed overview of the PostgreSQL schema, custom functions, and security policies that power the application, all managed by Supabase.

## Core Entities & Relationships

The database is designed around a few core concepts. Understanding their relationships is key to understanding the application.

- **`users`**: Stores the public-facing profiles for everyone who signs up. This is linked to Supabase's private `auth.users` table.
- **`questions`**: Contains all the GATE exam questions. This is the central content of the app.
- **`user_question_activity`**: Acts as a logbook. Every time a user attempts a question, a record is created here, linking a `user` to a `question`.
- **`question_peer_stats`**: An aggregate table that stores statistics (like average time, correct attempts) for each question, calculated from the `user_question_activity` data.
- **`question_reports`**: Allows users to report issues with specific questions.
- **`notifications`**: A simple table for storing in-app notifications for users.
- **`user_incorrect_queue`**: Table to store the incorrect attemtps of the user and then helps in Smart Revision
- **`weekly_revision_set`**: Table to store the weekly set of each user.
- **`revision_set_questions`**: Table to store the revision questions corresponding to each set.

## Table Reference

This section provides a detailed breakdown of each table in the `public` schema.

### Table: `public.users`

Stores public profile information for authenticated users. This table is linked 1-to-1 with the private `auth.users` table.

**Row Level Security (RLS) Policies:**

- **Policy:** A user can view, insert, or update their own row in the `users` table. They cannot access anyone else's.
- **SQL Logic:** `USING (auth.uid() = id) WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id)`

### Table: `public.revision_set_questions`

Stores the questions included in a weekly revision set along with user performance data.

| Column Name          | Data Type | Constraints & Defaults                                                               | Description                                       |
| :------------------- | :-------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| `set_id`             | `uuid`    | `PRIMARY KEY (composite)`, `REFERENCES weekly_revision_set(id)`, `ON DELETE CASCADE` | The revision set this question belongs to.        |
| `question_id`        | `uuid`    | `PRIMARY KEY (composite)`, `REFERENCES questions(id)`                                | The question included in the revision set.        |
| `is_correct`         | `boolean` | `NULL` allowed                                                                       | Whether the user answered the question correctly. |
| `time_spent_seconds` | `int`     | `NULL` allowed                                                                       | Time spent answering the question, in seconds.    |

**Notes:**

- Uses a composite primary key (`set_id`, `question_id`) to ensure each question appears only once per revision set.
- Rows are automatically removed when the parent revision set is deleted due to `ON DELETE CASCADE`.

## Database Functions

Custom SQL functions to handle complex logic directly in the database.

### Function: `insert_user_question_activity_batch(batch jsonb)`

- **Purpose:**
    - Processes a batch of user question attempts and applies different behaviors depending on whether the attempt occurs during **practice mode** or an **active weekly revision set**.
    - Records practice attempts in `user_question_activity`.
    - Updates the spaced-repetition queue in `user_incorrect_queue` **only for official revision attempts**.
    - Updates progress, accuracy, and completion state for an active `weekly_revision_set`.

---

- **Arguments:**
    - **batch (jsonb):**  
      A JSON array of question attempt objects. Each object must include:

        | Field Name     | Type          | Description                                          |
        | -------------- | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
        | `user_id`      | `uuid`        | The user attempting the question.                    |
        | `question_id`  | `uuid`        | The question being attempted.                        |
        | `subject`      | `text`        | Question subject (used for practice history).        |
        | `was_correct`  | `boolean`     | Whether the answer was correct. Defaults to `false`. |
        | `time_taken`   | `int`         | Time spent answering, in seconds.                    |
        | `attempted_at` | `timestamptz` | When the attempt occurred.                           |

---

- **Core Concepts:**
    - **Revision States:**
        - `none` – Practice attempt (not part of a revision set).
        - `first` – First attempt of a question within an active revision set.
        - `done` – Question already attempted in the active revision set (ignored).

    - **Active Revision Set:**
        - The function automatically resolves the user’s currently **started** `weekly_revision_set`.
        - Only one active set is considered at a time.

---

- **Logic Flow:**
    1. **Batch Iteration**
        - Iterates through each item in the input JSON array.

    2. **Revision State Resolution**
        - Checks if the question belongs to the user’s active revision set.
        - Determines whether the attempt is:
            - A practice attempt
            - The first revision attempt
            - A duplicate revision attempt (skipped)

    3. **Hard Stop for Duplicate Revision Attempts**
        - If the question has already been answered in the revision set (`done`), the attempt is ignored.

    4. **Practice Mode Handling (`revision_state = 'none'`)**
        - Inserts a new record into `user_question_activity`.
        - Automatically increments `attempt_number` per user/question pair.
        - Practice attempts **do not** affect spaced-repetition boxes except for wrong attempts.
        - If it is an incorrect attempt then that question is inserted into `user_incorrect_queue` with `box=1`.

    5. **Spaced Repetition Queue (`user_incorrect_queue`)**
        - Applied only for:
            - Practice attempts (`none`) **when inserting new incorrect questions**
            - First revision attempts (`first`) **when updating existing entries**
        - **Insert Rules:**
            - A question is added to the queue **only if answered incorrectly**.
        - **Update Rules (revision only):**
            - Correct answers move questions forward:
                - Box 1 → Box 2 → Box 3 → Removed
            - Incorrect answers reset the question to Box 1.
        - **Review Scheduling:**
            - Box 1 → +1 week
            - Box 2 → +2 weeks
            - Box 3 → +4 weeks

    6. **Revision Set Question Update (`first` attempt only)**
        - Updates `revision_set_questions` with correctness and time spent.
        - Recalculates:
            - Total questions
            - Correct count
            - Accuracy percentage

    7. **Revision Set Completion**
        - If all questions have been attempted, the function triggers
          `update_status_of_weekly_set(...)` to expire or finalize the set.

---

- **Key Behaviors & Guarantees:**
    - Revision questions can only be answered **once** per weekly set.
    - Practice attempts never affect revision accuracy.
    - Spaced-repetition box movement happens **only during official revision attempts**.
    - Incorrect questions are the only ones added to the repetition queue.
    - Weekly accuracy is computed as:
        ```
        (correct_questions / attempted_questions) * 100
        ```

---

- **Return Value:**
    - **void**

---

- **Example:**
    - If a user practices a question outside a revision set:
        - The attempt is logged.
        - The spaced-repetition queue is unchanged unless the answer is incorrect.
    - If the same question is attempted during an active revision set:
        - The first attempt updates revision progress and the queue.
        - Any subsequent attempts are ignored.

---

- **Exceptions & Safety:**
    - Duplicate revision attempts are safely skipped.
    - Partial revision updates are prevented by hard checks on attempt state.
    - Batch processing ensures consistent handling of multiple attempts in one call.

### Function: `refresh_question_peer_stats()`

- **Purpose:** To calculate and update the aggregate statistics in the `question_peer_stats` table.
- **Arguments:** None.
- **Logic:** It queries the `user_question_activity` table, grouping by `question_id` to calculate the total attempts, correct/wrong counts, and average time taken for first attempts (`attempt_number = 1`). It then uses `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` to either insert a new stats row or update an existing one for each question.
- **Security:** This function is `SECURITY DEFINER`, meaning it runs with the permissions of the user who defined it (the database owner), allowing it to safely read all activity data to generate accurate stats.

### Function: `generate_weekly_revision_set()`

- **Purpose**: To generate a weekly revision set for a user based on their progress in the `user_incorrect_queue` table. This function selects questions for revision, prioritizing based on the Leitner lite system (3-box system) and ranks them to ensure the most relevant questions are reviewed first. It creates a new revision set for the week if one doesn't already exist.
- **Arguments**: None: This function does not accept any external parameters. It derives the user ID (v_user_id) from the current authenticated user using `auth.uid()`.
- **Logic**:
    - **Authentication Check**: The function first checks if the user is authenticated. If not, it raises an exception.
    - **Start of the Week Calculation**: It calculates the start of the current week (Sunday) to prevent generating multiple revision sets for the same week.
    - **Existing Set Check**: It checks if a revision set has already been created for the user for the current week. If found, it returns the existing set ID and a message.
    - **Creating New Revision Set**: If no set exists, it inserts a new entry in the `weekly_revision_set` table with a status of pending.
    - **Populating Revision Set**:
        - The function selects questions from the `user_incorrect_queue` table that are due for review (i.e., next_review_at is less than or equal to the current date).
        - It then ranks the questions within each box using `ROW_NUMBER()`, ensuring that the questions from _box 3_ are given priority, followed by _box 2_, and then _box 1_.
        - A maximum of 30 questions are selected to populate the revision set.
    - **Return**: The function returns a JSON object with the `set_id`, `status`, the count of questions added to the set, and a success message.
- **Return Value**:
    - A `json` object containing:
        - **set_id**: The ID of the generated or existing weekly revision set.
        - **status**: Either existing (if the set already exists) or created (if a new set is generated).
        - **questions_count**: The number of questions added to the revision set.
        - **message**: A message indicating whether the set was newly created or already exists.
- **Example**:
    ```json
    {
        "set_id": "uuid",
        "status": "created",
        "questions_count": 30,
        "message": "Generated new smart revision set."
    }
    ```
- **Exceptions**:
    - If the user is not authenticated, an exception is raised with the message Not authenticated.
    - If an error occurs during the function execution, a general error message is raised.

### Function: `update_status_of_weekly_set(v_set_id uuid)`

- **Purpose:**
    - To update the status of a weekly revision set to `expired` after 24 hours have passed from the `started_at` time. This function is invoked from the client-side to ensure that the set cannot be used after the expiration period has passed. It provides feedback on whether the set was updated successfully or if there was an issue (e.g., set not found or already expired).

- **Arguments:**
    - **v_set_id (uuid):** The unique identifier of the weekly revision set to be updated.

- **Logic:**
    - **Authentication Check:**
        - The function first retrieves the current authenticated user's ID using `auth.uid()`. If the user is not authenticated (i.e., `v_user_id` is `NULL`), an exception is raised with the message `Not authenticated`.
    - **Set Status Update:**
        - The function attempts to update the status of the revision set with the given `v_set_id` to `'expired'`. The update happens only if the `generated_for` matches the authenticated user’s ID (`v_user_id`).
    - **Rows Affected Check:**
        - If no rows are affected by the `UPDATE` (i.e., the set was not found or has already been expired), the function returns a message indicating that the set was not found or is already expired.
    - **Return Success or Failure:**
        - If the status is successfully updated, a success message is returned indicating the revision set is now marked as expired.
        - If the set could not be found, a failure message is returned.

- **Return Value:**
    - A `json` object with the following keys:
        - **success (boolean):** Indicates whether the operation was successful (`true`) or failed (`false`).
        - **message (string):** A message providing additional information about the outcome. It can either confirm the successful update or explain why the update was not performed (e.g., "No such weekly set found or already expired").

- **Example:**
    - **Success:**
        ```json
        {
            "success": true,
            "message": "Weekly set status updated to expired."
        }
        ```
    - **Failure:**
        ```json
        {
            "success": false,
            "message": "No such weekly set found or already expired."
        }
        ```
- **Exceptions**:
    - If the user is not authenticated (i.e., auth.uid() returns NULL), an exception is raised with the message Not authenticated.
    - If no matching revision set is found or it is already expired, the function returns a failure message instead of an exception.

### Function: `start_weekly_revision_set(v_set_id uuid)`

- **Purpose:**
    - To mark the weekly revision set as "started" by setting the `started_at` and `expires_at` timestamps. This function is invoked when the user starts revising a weekly set. It ensures that the set's status changes from `pending` to `started` and calculates an expiration time of 24 hours from the start time.

- **Arguments:**
    - **v_set_id (uuid):** The unique identifier of the weekly revision set that is being started.

- **Logic:**
    - **Authentication Check:**
        - The function first retrieves the current authenticated user's ID using `auth.uid()`. If the user is not authenticated (i.e., `v_user_id` is `NULL`), an exception is raised with the message `Not authenticated`.
    - **Update Status:**
        - The function attempts to update the `status` of the weekly revision set with the given `v_set_id` to `'started'` and sets the `started_at` and `expires_at` timestamps.
        - The update occurs only if the set is currently in the `pending` state.
    - **Check if Update Was Successful:**
        - The function checks whether any rows were affected by the update (i.e., if the set was in `pending` status). If no rows were updated, it returns a failure message indicating that the set could not be started.
    - **Return Success or Failure:**
        - If the status is successfully updated, a success message is returned indicating the revision set has been started along with the `set_id`, `started_at`, and `expires_at` timestamps.
        - If no matching set was found (i.e., it was not in `pending` status), a failure message is returned.

- **Return Value:**
    - A `json` object with the following keys:
        - **success (boolean):** Indicates whether the operation was successful (`true`) or failed (`false`).
        - **set_id (uuid):** The ID of the set that was updated.
        - **started_at (timestamp):** The timestamp when the revision set was started.
        - **expires_at (timestamp):** The timestamp when the revision set expires (24 hours from the start).
        - **message (string):** A message providing additional information about the outcome.

- **Example:**
    - **Success:**
        ```json
        {
            "success": true,
            "set_id": "some-uuid",
            "started_at": "2025-12-08T10:00:00Z",
            "expires_at": "2025-12-09T10:00:00Z",
            "message": "Weekly set started."
        }
        ```
    - **Failure:**
        ```json
        {
            "success": false,
            "message": "Could not start the weekly set. It may not be in pending status or does not exist."
        }
        ```
- **Exception**
    - If the user is not authenticated (i.e., auth.uid() returns NULL), an exception is raised with the message Not authenticated.
    - If no matching revision set is found or if the set is not in the pending status, the function returns a failure message.

### Function: `get_weekly_set()`

- **Purpose:**
    - To retrieve the currently available weekly revision set for the user. The function checks if the user has an active (pending or started) weekly revision set, and returns the set's details. If the set has expired, it is updated to an `expired` status before returning the set.

- **Arguments:**
    - **None.**

- **Logic:**
    - **Authentication Check:**
        - The function retrieves the current authenticated user's ID using `auth.uid()`. If the user is not authenticated (i.e., `v_user_id` is `NULL`), an exception is raised with the message `Not authenticated`.
    - **Status Update:**
        - The function calls the `update_status_of_weekly_set()` function to update any `pending` or `started` weekly revision set to `expired` if the time window has passed (24 hours from the `started_at` time).
    - **Fetch Weekly Set:**
        - After ensuring expired sets are updated, the function fetches the user's `weekly_revision_set` that is either `pending` or `started`.
    - **Return Success or Failure:**
        - If no matching revision set is found, the function returns a failure message (`No weekly set available for the user`).
        - If a valid revision set is found, the function returns the set's details in JSON format, including the `success` status and the revision set details (`set_info`).

- **Return Value:**
    - A `json` object with the following keys:
        - **success (boolean):** Indicates whether the operation was successful (`true`) or failed (`false`).
        - **set_info (jsonb):** The details of the found weekly revision set (if available).
        - **message (string):** A message providing additional information about the outcome.

- **Example:**
    - **Success:**
        ```json
        {
            "success": true,
            "set_info": {
                "id": "some-uuid",
                "generated_for": "some-uuid",
                "start_of_week": "2025-12-07",
                "status": "pending",
                "created_at": "2025-12-07T00:00:00Z"
            },
            "message": "Weekly set available"
        }
        ```
    - **Failure:**
        ```json
        {
            "success": false,
            "message": "No weekly set available for the user"
        }
        ```
- **Exception**
    - If the user is not authenticated (i.e., auth.uid() returns NULL), an exception is raised with the message Not authenticated.
    - If no matching revision set is found or all available sets are expired, the function returns a failure message instead of an exception.
